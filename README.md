# PALEORCA2-demonstrator

The PALEORCA2 demonstrator is a use case for the NEMO ocean model based on the default configuration ORCA2_ICE_PISCES. This tutorial describes how to set-up and run the default configuration as well as selected possible adjustments to customise the simulation. 

The adjustments described in this tutorial are
* how to add a new diagnostic to the model outputs
* how to change the vertical resolution
* how to set up ORCA2 to simulate the Earth in the early Eocene

This demonstrator is a contribution to the NEMO Zoo hackathon 2025.
