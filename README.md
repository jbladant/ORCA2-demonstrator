# ORCA2-demonstrator

The ORCA2 demonstrator is a use case for the NEMO ocean model based on the default configuration ORCA2_ICE_PISCES. This tutorial describes how to set-up and run the default configuration as well as selected adjustments to customise the simulation. 

#### The default ORCA2_ICE_PISCES

[How to run ORCA_ICE_PISCES](https://github.com/jbladant/ORCA2-demonstrator/blob/main/Running%20ORCA2_ICE_PISCES.md) describes the steps necessary for compiling and running the default ORCA2_ICE_PISCES configuration. This is the prerequisite for making the adjustment described in the following. 

<!-- #### Making adjustments for different levels of experience with NEMO -->
#### Customizations
[How to add new variables to the outputs](https://github.com/jbladant/ORCA2-demonstrator/blob/main/Add%20new%20outputs.md), including adding new variables and changing outputting frequency. 

[How to change the vertical resolution in ORCA2](https://github.com/jbladant/ORCA2-demonstrator/blob/main/ORCA2L75_configuration.md), in this case increasing the number of levels from 31 levels (default) to 75 levels by using the DOMAINcfg tool. 

[How to create a Paleo Earth set-up for the early Eocene](https://github.com/jbladant/ORCA2-demonstrator/blob/main/Paleo_Earth.md), including changes in location of continents, rotating the tripolar grid, and changing bathymetry.

This demonstrator is a contribution to the NEMO Zoo hackathon 2025.
