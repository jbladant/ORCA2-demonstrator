# ORCA2-demonstrator

The ORCA2 demonstrator is a use case for the NEMO ocean model based on the default configuration ORCA2_ICE_PISCES. This tutorial describes how to set-up and run the default configuration as well as selected possible adjustments to customise the simulation. 

#### The default ORCA2_ICE_PISCES

[How to run ORCA_ICE_PISCES](https://github.com/jbladant/ORCA2-demonstrator/blob/main/Running%20ORCA2_ICE_PISCES.md) describes the steps necessary for running the default ORCA2_ICE_PISCES configuration. This is the prerequisite for making the adjustment described in the following. 

#### Making adjustments for different levels of experience with NEMO
[How to add new variables to the outputs](https://github.com/jbladant/ORCA2-demonstrator/blob/main/Add%20new%20outputs.md) describes how to adjust the model output, including adding new variables and changing outputting frequency. 



The adjustments described in this tutorial are
* how to add a new diagnostic to the model outputs
* how to change the vertical resolution
* how to set up ORCA2 to simulate the Earth in the early Eocene

This demonstrator is a contribution to the NEMO Zoo hackathon 2025.
