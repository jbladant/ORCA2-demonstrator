# Tutorial for creating PAleo Earth

This tutorial allows you to run an Early Eocene (~ 55 Ma) NEMO simulation.
The bathymetry follows that provided by the model intercomparison project focussing on the Early Eocene ([**DeepMIP**](https://www.deepmip.org/deepmip-eocene/)). Details about the boundary conditions can be found [**here**](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/10/889/2017/) and the first results of this exercise are documented [**here**](https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/17/203/2021/cp-17-203-2021.html).
This training guide is based on a modified global ORCA2 grid with displaced poles to accommodate the different global land/sea mask. The nominal resolution is 2° with enhancement in the equatorial band up to 0.5° resolution at the equator).
